	pip install -r requirements.txt

2. the core server can be run using ./core.py

3. the text based console can be run using ./rogue-console.py

see the various help info for details (-h)
if the interface are not told which core to use then they use localhost (starting one if necessary)

the swagger api can be seen on the core server in /api/spec.html
